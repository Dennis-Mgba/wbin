            Bride covers anyone planning either to have a wedding
            or vow renewal. To participate, the Bride would need to
            subscribe to WBIN discount code at N10,000 (Ten Thousand Naira Only).
            This automatically entitles one to enjoy all the exclusive WBIN juicy
            discounts offered by about 1000 partnering vendors displayed as
            Exhibitors under our DISCOUNT menu and listed in our DIRECTORY menu.

                Upon subscription to our Discount Code you may choose to participate
                 at no extra cost in the Princess & Queen of all WBIN benefits â€“
                 Freebies & Reality respectively.

                Note that once you sign on to WBIN via the discount code, it remains
                 valid even if you have attempted our Reality and/or Freebies platform
                  but did not win. Great
